SportsBall Manager lets users take on the role of the manager of their own sports team, for the fictional sport SportsBall. Managers will be able to make adjustments to their stadiums to allow for a higher audience capacity, manage a roster by promoting players to serve as captain or benching them for a game, and trading players with other managers. After 10 days, an "offseason" of 1 day gives managers the opportunity to re-sign players, finalize deals with other managers, or make last minute changes to their stadium.
